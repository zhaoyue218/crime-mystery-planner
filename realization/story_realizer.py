            "The final story must remain fully consistent with the hidden truth and plot steps, but it should read like an actual mystery story rather than a report.\n\n"

            "Hard constraints:\n"
            "- Do not contradict the hidden truth.\n"
            "- Do not change the culprit, motive, method, or evidence chain.\n"
            "- Do not invent major new plot events that are not supported by the plan.\n"
            "- Do not omit the key investigative developments in the plot steps.\n"
            "- The final confrontation and resolution must clearly rely on the key evidence chain.\n\n"

            "- Make the story immersive, smooth, and highly readable.\n"
            "- Turn each plot step into a short narrative scene or beat, not a dry summary.\n"

            "- Keep the prose clear and elegant rather than overly flowery.\n"

            "Narrative style instructions:\n"
            "- Write in polished third-person mystery prose.\n"
            "- Use paragraphs, not bullet points or step-by-step labels.\n"
            "- Do not explicitly mention 'Step 1', 'Step 2', or any structured field names.\n"
            "- Integrate evidence naturally into the narration through discovery, discussion, or inference.\n"
            "- When moving from one plot step to another, add brief connective narration so the story flows naturally.\n"
